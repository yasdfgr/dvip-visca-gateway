# dvip-visca-gateway

The purpose of this project is to create a dvip (datavideo proprietary protocol) to visca communication because RMC-300A control panel seems to be only working correct with datavideo ptz cameras.
So i hope to overcome this behaviour.

Based on the work of
- https://github.com/BB21B/datavideo-dvip-docs
- https://github.com/bitfocus/companion-module-datavideo-dvip
- https://github.com/foxworth42/arduino-VISCA-controller

First step will be to select a microcontroller hw, like arduino to act as the gateway.
Second step is to get the basic communication working (dvip and visca over ip)
